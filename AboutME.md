# Gayatri-s-Research-Portfolio-


I am a PhD candidate with a deep desire and dedication to understanding and combating neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes. My academic journey has equipped me with a robust background in epidemiology and pharmacology, which I blend with my data science skills to analyze and interpret complex health data. My research focuses on uncovering the underlying mechanisms of these diseases and exploring innovative treatment approaches. I am particularly interested in how large-scale data analysis can better inform healthcare strategies and interventions. I aim to contribute significantly to the medical field through my research and expertise in these areas.
